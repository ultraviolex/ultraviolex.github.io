	This summer, I've been focusing on continuing updating my website and making small changes such as adding and adjusting things! I'm really happy that I've been able to learn a decent amount of HTML and CSS within two weeks or so. I'm also learning C++ as well and it hasn't been bad, especially since I have a decent grasp of Python and Java already. I know for sure that I'm planning on doing my own data analysis project before school starts back up in the fall; I'm hoping to have at least one completely finished and on this website by August.

	This is my first blog post! Wow! Pretty exciting stuff if you ask me. Anyway, this is really more of a test post as I'm still coding the website right now. I just wanted to go ahead and add this post so that there would be something on this page.
