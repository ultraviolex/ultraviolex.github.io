	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Violex and I am senior at UC Berkeley studying data science. 
	I started this website as a fun summer project but I'm hoping that it'll serve as a sort of a live resume where I can 
	record my experiences regarding my studies and career as well as show off some of my personal projects!
	<br>
	<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I graduated in 2017 in the top 4% from Clear Lake High School in Houston, Texas, 
	where I've lived most of my life. After graduating, I moved halfway across the country to attend college 
	at UC Berkeley. I entered college thinking that I would exit with a degree in biochem and go to medical school, 
	but life doesn't always work out the way it's planned. I switched to data science after my first year because 
	I realized that I wasn't interested in any of the courses I had taken and that learning the material had become a chore instead of
	being enjoyable. Even though some might see switching as a bad decision as it essentially meant my first year 
	would go to waste, switching majors is the best 
	decision I've ever made. I'm thankful to finally have found an area of study that I'm genuinely interested in and 
	I'm super excited to see where data science takes me. 
	<br>

	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In my free time, you'll most likely find me studying with friends late into the night, at the campus gym working out, cooking, or in my room painting. 
	I like to describe myself as someone who is genuine to herself and her values and this carries over into my professional life; I love to learn new things and 
	to learn them thoroughly, which can be a curse at times because I don't like moving on unless it's perfect. I'm very passionate about data analysis,
	 AI, machine learning, social activism, and animals! (Bonus pic of my dog, Cocoa!)
