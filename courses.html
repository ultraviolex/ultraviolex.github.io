	<b>Computer Science 61A</b> (Spring 2019)
	<br>
	CS61A focuses on the idea of abstraction and primarily uses the Python3 programming language. Besides learning how to code in python, I also gained 
	a lot of knowledge regarding the conceptual aspect of coding. One of my favorite parts of the class would be the environmental diagrams because 
	I not only found them fun, but I also found them useful in understanding how a computer reads code and how I can be more efficient on my end.
	You can view the course website <a href="https://cs61a.org/">here</a> for more information regarding the course.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Data 8</b> (Spring 2019)
	<br>
	DATA8 is Berkeley's introductory data science course. I was introduced to various aspects of data analysis and practiced those concepts through weekly 
	homeworks and labs. The projects in the course were long but definitely improved my skills as a data analyst and a programmer. 
	You can view the course website <a href="http://data8.org/sp19/">here</a> for more information regarding the course. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Fundamentals of Programming</b> (Summer 2019)
	<br>
	I took this course through my local community college over summer for fun. It is an introductory course that teaches about the fundamentals of game programming 
	using C++. Although about programming games, the biggest takeaway for me was learning a new programming language
	and being able to apply that new knowledge. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Computer Science 61B</b> (Spring 2020)
	<br>
	CS61B explores data structures and goes over a lot of the material that is taught in CS61A at a much deeper level and 
	the coursework is significanly heavier. Despite being somewhat infamous for its difficulty and heavy courseload, 
	I found this course to be enjoyable. The heavy courseload made me a faster and more 
	efficient programmer and student and the projects gave me the opportunity to utilize what I learned and code entire programs from scratch. 
	The course website can be found <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20">here</a>. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Computer Science 70</b> (Spring 2020)
	<br>
	CS70 is an introductory course focusing on discrete mathematics and probability theory and is infamous for it's difficult
	course material and workload. Although not required for my major, this class introduced a lot of concepts that the classes I plan to take 
	later on will utilize. The course website can be found <a href="https://www.eecs70.org">here</a>.
